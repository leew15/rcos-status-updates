## Last Week's Accomplishments

Cleaned up some guides, and put my engineerlog information in some of them as well. Other than that, I hadn't done much new learning this week, maybe except some more github formatting but that wasn't that much either. Pushed some of my documentation and guides on my branch I used earlier the semester so that future people may see it.

## This Week's Plan

I will be focusing on my final work this semester, but if there are any fixes required I will hop on that.

## Anything Blocking?

Nope

## SEMESTER ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 

This semster I got introduced to github and its uses in projects. Being that this was my first time in a group project of this scale, I realized the usefulness of git. I learned about commits, pushing, branches, forks and how the whole system works in unison. I learned about the terminal commands and became rather proficient. Another thing I learned on github was Documentation Formatting in md files for later in the semster, to help future hedgehogs contributors. The first half of the semester I worked on the data-pipeline team, and had to learn about postGreSQL from scratch, and how to connect/view/manipulate them on the terminal. From there I learned about manipulating the server on python scripts using pyscopg2. From there I parsed the inputs from the financial data in FinSim and pushed onto the table with identifications using UUIDs. This was then documented with new user guides to help people later if they wanted to change something about the schemas or add new tables in the postgres server. I pushed a plain text file with the schemas of the tables in the semester (I think it's changed since then) but it gives a visual of everything for people who need to know what kinds of info the schema holds without needing to know postgres, like maybe future django people. The last thing i did with postGreSQL was doing management of the schemas, i.e. making sure the names of the tables were intuitive like company_eod into end_of_day_data. Towards the second half of the semester I was moved to the front-end team after we finished the goals of the semester for the backend datapipeline. This was a challenge to try to catch up in web development from nothing, so I just mainly did research (bootstrap and HTML, and some CSS/JS). By the time I had the skill to make meaningful contributions, we had the presentations and most of our frontend goals were met, so I chose to do documentation for my learning progress (both postgres stuff and HTML stuff).
