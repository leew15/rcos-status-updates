## Last Week's Accomplishments

Renamed certain tables within postgreSQL, i.e. "eod_table" -> end_of_data_table, to make it easier to access later with django. Alongside this, I documented the Schemas for the datapipeline and django tables on postgres for discussion later.

## This Week's Plan

I'll look to start a documentation whenever there is a lull in work, that lets new members understand current data pipeline work and certain installations needed for getting started, like psycopg basics, how to install postgresql/basic commands to succeed in our server, and how to understand and use current scripts.

## Anything Blocking?

N/A

## Notes

None!
