## Last Week's Accomplishments

Started tutorials on spider webscraping for access to websites like yahoo finance. Starting the script/parsing for the data to scrape from a request. Downloading PostGres was at a halt for a bit because I encountered errors from WSL so I just did some work that a member reccomended us to do for later (the scraping).

## This Week's Plan

Starting work on the ticket for pushing finsim data to PostGres table with uuid as unique key. Will have to figure out postgres table concepts and learning how to code with them.

## Anything Blocking?

It took me a while to get postGres on my computer because of WSL bugs. Fixed them so hopefully it goes well from here.

## Notes

Still a bit unfamiliar with postgres and the general concepts, but I know enough to get started.
