## Last Week's Accomplishments

Thanksgiving break so not much, I just fixed certain formatting in my engineering logs where I was learning about github formatting with md files, and I found some formatting was off
(In case I forget to link my forked repo with test/learning code, guides, and engineer log commits, here: https://github.com/leew15/hedgehogs but I also have some on branch on the main hedgehogs)

## This Week's Plan

I'm going to see if I can learn more HTML/CSS/. After doing research with BootStrap with the resources the team reccomended, I realized my knowledge of web knowledge isn't sufficient for the code required to really get some detailed additions into the website that isn't already done (Not the basics like web setup, but more advanced formatting). While doing it I will be documenting hurdles with guides/logs
