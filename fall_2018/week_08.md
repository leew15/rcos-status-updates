## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finished a psycopg2 example document for new user, based on my earlier commit on the postgres server with explanations along my code. Since last week when I realized I needed to know more about HTML and web programming to help the frontend team with bootstrap, I decided to search for a few resources to learn about HTML (My more technical explanations available in the engineering log 2). I have a generally good understanding of the basics, but now that'll require me to understand JS and CSS in order to dress up the HTML.

## This Week's Plan

Now that our main goals for presentable work is ready, I'll be able to work more for my own development (since any amount of front end I could work on is already accomplished) such as JS and CSS work to compliment my HTML learning. The OAuth for our website that I wanted to work on that I mentioned in the engineer log was completed by one of our team members which is great to hear, but that also means I have to reroute for this week. I want to actually focus on the more new user guides that I have been working on this year this week, this way I can make meaningful contributions for this project of incoming open source users now that our semester goals have been finished. Also, some of the front-end people want to work together to finalize our demo that we will present this friday, so that is what I'll be prioritizing first.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing this week!
