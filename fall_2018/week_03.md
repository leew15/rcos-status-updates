## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finally got some viewable progress with the postgres. After getting familiarized with psycopg2 which is a way to write scripts for postgreSQL, I started with a basic test to figure out syntax of not only psycopg2 but also apply the knowledge I learned over the past weeks on SQL. After that, I pushed a table onto postgres server with data from our finsim data with the following columns: UUID, TICKERNAME, TICKERID. Was pretty glad I could finally get some results after weeks of errors and trying to get my head around database programming.

## This Week's Plan

This week I will try to work out other tables and their schemas. With Duke, we will try to push more info onto the postgres server.

## Anything Blocking?

Although I have understood the basics of SQL, There is alot I still do not know. Working with Ranjit, I will try to get a better understanding, while applying them through our database.

## Notes

I want to work with my teammates more now that I have gotten these down.
