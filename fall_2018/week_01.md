## Last Week's Accomplishments

	Exploring the tools needed for Hedgehogs. Learned of issues with WSL and Docker, and bugs with downloading docker
	Downloaded data from SimFin financial data, and tried to parse the data using python.
	Was a simple parser that separated the csv file into a list, maybe we can eventually clean out rough edges but the main goal is to just get the data into postgres servers.


## This Week's Plan

	I would enjoy it if I could even learn some of this information for future projects outside of Hedgehogs, since these are very useful tools with many applicable situations.
	Learn information on postGresSQL using, in order to place information parsed from our data into the server.
	Once input data into server, learn about the tools available from postgres.


## Anything Blocking?

	I don't have much experience coding with new tools like postgres and sql style code. 
	I will have to do alot of figuring out of how these tools will connect and be relevent with each other.

## Notes

	I have looked and become more familiar with programming with databases, but still needs work.
