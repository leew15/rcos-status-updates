## Last Week's Accomplishments

We reorganized the structure of the team from more broad to be more specified in order to have a working demo for the large group presentation. One big thing that changed for me was that since data-piplelining is getting there, I was assigned to help the front end, so I have been trying to communicate with Dylan and Morgan (Front end) to get what we need for the presentation.

## This Week's Plan

I will start to learn on more front end material with web development and getting started on a few tutorials. I will try to record my progress learning, maybe making it easier for later members to understand issues if I stumble across anything. Because I'm joining a subteam that has been working on this the whole semester, it feels a bit rough but hopefully I can keep up.

## Anything Blocking?
